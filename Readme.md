# Libra package

***Libra*** is a Mathematica package for transforming first-order linear differential systems. Its main purpose is the reduction to Îµ-form. 
It can also be used for the reduction to Fuchsian form and as a convenient tool for applying linear transformations of functions. It can handle univariate, as well as multivariate systems.

1. Copy the content of the `Source/` directory to the desired location, say `home/of/Libra`
2. Change to this location with `cd home/of/Libra`
3. Run `math -script makeShortcut.m`

Result: 
You can load Libra package from Mathematica session with ``<<Libra` ``



##### Using Fermat CAS

Libra can benefit from using Robert H. Lewis' [Fermat CAS](http://home.bway.net/lewis/). The interface package ***Fermatica*** can be downloaded from [Fermatica repository](https://bitbucket.org/rnlee/fermatica/src/master/). When ***Fermatica*** is installed and working, it can be loaded along with ***LiteRed2***  via `` <<Fermatica` `` and used via  option `UseFermat->True` of several Libra procedures.
